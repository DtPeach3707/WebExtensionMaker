# How to Put the Commands on Your Computer

<strong>For Unix</strong>

Run the following code in your terminal:

<code>cd ~</code> (This will bring you to the root directory)

<code>touch ~/.custom_commands.sh</code> (This will create a file where you can put all of the functions that you want)

<code>open ~/.custom_commands.sh</code> (This will open that file you created)

At this point, copy-paste any function that you want from the <code>shell</code> directory of this repo in that file, making sure to have <code>#!bin/bash</code> on the top!<br>
Then, run <code>source ~/.custom_commands.sh</code> To update your file, and you should be good to go!
